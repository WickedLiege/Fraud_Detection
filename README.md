# Fraud_Detection

I developed a credit card fraud detection system using XGBoost, which achieved an accuracy rate of 91% in accurately classifying legitimate transactions. To ensure the integrity and reliability of the data, I utilized the SimpleImputer module from the renowned scikit-learn library, effectively handling missing values in the dataset. Applying preprocessing techniques, I focused on enhancing the data quality by reducing the number of features from 434 to 232 through correlation analysis. This step not only improved the efficiency of the model but also reduced dimensionality, resulting in a more streamlined and optimized dataset. By implementing feature selection based on correlation analysis, I successfully identified and selected the most relevant features, improving the overall data quality and enhancing the performance of the fraud detection system.
